# array = list ,dictionary,tuple,set
# In most of the language array start from the zero

# Know how to convert a number into the binary
# 4 byte is the capacity to store integer number in many programming languages.
# 1 byte = 8 bit= 00000000
# 4 byte = 32 bit
# 1 bit = 0.125 byte

# In python, list is implemented as dynamic array

# IN Java
# array
# 1. static array = size of the list is fixed you can not store more
#                    the size of the list. you have given in java
# 2. dynamin array = you don't have to specify the size of an array
#                     just keep on adding element and it just keep on growing
#                     in java example is ArrayList


 # array works according geometric progression.
